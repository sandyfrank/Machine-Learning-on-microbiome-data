# Machine-Learning-on-microbiome-data
Discovery of microbial signatures on microbiome data using machine learning algorithms


The primary goal of this project was to utilize the species abundance information along with its associated metadata in order to discover microbiome-based signatures for this specific pathological condition. Within this framework, we employed two types of analyses. First, we conducted univariate analyses to identify differentially abundant species, a common technique employed in the field. Second, we utilized multivariate machine learning methods to build predictive models and determine the importance of different features in the dataset. A second objective of the project was to evaluate the predictive capabilities of multiple machine learning algorithms based on their performance as well as their capability to identify intepretable signatures. This assessment aimed to identify the most effective method to be subsequently employed in the lab.
